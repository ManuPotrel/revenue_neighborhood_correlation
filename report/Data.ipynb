    "\n",
    "We will also use data gathered by the <a href='https://www.insee.fr/en/accueil'>INSEE</a> to get the latitude and longitude of each Paris neighborhood. You can download it <a href='https://data.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/code-postal-code-insee-2015%40public/table/'>here</a>.<br>\n",

    "We will then be able to engineer a new feature, the `center_distance` feature indicating how far each neighborhood is from downtown. This is a relevant factor when classifying neighborhoods.\n",

    "With this data, we are planning to use the <a href='https://foursquare.com/'>FourSquare</a> API to get all the information we need about the venues in each neighborhood.<br>\n",
    "The presence of certain types of venues will be the features that help us segment the neighborhoods in several categories (for now, 5 will be enough)."
